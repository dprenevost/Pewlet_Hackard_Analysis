  * As you can see there are 72,458 employees retiring.

  * The number of eligible current employees that are able to mentor others:
    * 1549 Total
    


## Summary:  The "Silver Tsunami" is comming!  

Assuming that advancements in technology and automation cannot be utilized to eliminate open positions, there will be a deficit of about 90,398 positions after the "silver tsunami" hits.  By increasing the age range for the mentorship program you can increase your available mentors my orders of magnitude.  This will give the company the ability to lessen the impact of retirements greatly by being able to train in new and existing employees into the vacated roles.

With only 1549 Total eligble mentors to train new or current employees to fill the positions being vacated, there are too few to train the next wave of employees to fill all the positions that will be vacant.

By expanding the criteria for the "Eligible Mentors" by one year, from 1965 as the hard low limit to 1964, we were able to increase that number to almost 20,000.

Similarly we can further reduce this gap by again increasing the age range for mentorship to 1963.  This increases the number of mentors to around 38,000.
